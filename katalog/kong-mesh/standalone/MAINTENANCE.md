# Kong Mesh

The manifests in the current folders were generated in this way:

## Kumactl download and alias

First of all, download the version you need for kumactl package and point to it for the next commands.
```bash
cd ../../tools/kong-mesh
./download.sh
alias kumactl=$PWD/kumactl

# Test if you get the version you expect
kumactl version

```

## Control Plane

Move to the folder `global-control-plane` and run the following commands:

```bash
kumactl install control-plane \
  --without-kubernetes-connection \
  --mode=standalone \
  --ingress-enabled > resources/kong-mesh-standalone.yml

```

In `kustomization.yaml`Â and `patches/kong-mesh-init-image.yaml` the default images are overridden by Sighup registry ones.
