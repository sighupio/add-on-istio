# Jaeger Operator Maintenance Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines automated steps for maintaining the Jaeger Operator using the `maintenance.sh` script. It automates the download, splitting, and initial configuration building of the Jaeger Operator. This script is a tool to facilitate the update process but requires manual review to ensure that significant changes are identified and appropriately managed.

## Script Actions

1. **Download**: Fetches the specified version of the Jaeger Operator from the official GitHub repository.
2. **Check and Install Dependencies**: Ensures `kubectl-slice` is installed for handling YAML file operations.
3. **Split YAML File**: Divides the large YAML into smaller, individual files for easier management.
4. **Build with Kustomize**: Compiles the resources into a single `upstream.yaml` configuration file.
5. **Clean Up**: Removes the original downloaded file to maintain a clean working environment.

## Important Notes

- **Directory Structure**: The script creates a `jaeger-operator` directory with a `resources` subdirectory for organized storage.
- **Manual Review Required**: After running the script, it is crucial for developers to compare the generated `upstream.yaml` with the current local configuration. This comparison helps identify any significant changes or updates that may impact the existing deployment.
- **Handling Significant Changes**: If critical updates are detected, developers should document and communicate these changes to relevant stakeholders to decide on further actions.

## Usage

Run the script within your terminal with appropriate permissions:
```bash
bash maintenance.sh
```
Ensure `curl`, `Go`, `kubectl-slice`, and `Kustomize` are installed on your system before running the script.

This guide is designed for professional use, providing clear instructions and emphasizing critical evaluations and communications required after script execution.
