## When using the operator in cluster-wide mode, this ClusterRole has to be created and bound to the jaeger-operator service account,
## so that the operator can watch and create resources in every namespace in the cluster.
## An alternative to this cluster role is to create one role binding for each namespace that the operator should watch
## in that case, don't forget to add a comma-separated list of namespaces as WATCH_NAMESPACE in the operator's deployment.
## Further down in this file there's another set of rules, with extra optional permissions
