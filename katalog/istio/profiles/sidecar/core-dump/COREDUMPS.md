# Core Dumps(WIP)


Why we enable it:
- Diagnostics for Stage/Test environments
- Performace and memory leaks

Why NOT:
- Security, dumps may contains sensitive informations
- Limited Storage, core dumps makes a lot of dump Files(Gigabites)
- Limited I/O, host node may can crash due the intensive I/O.
