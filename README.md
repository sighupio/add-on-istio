# Fury Kubernetes Service Mesh

This repository contains all needed components to deploy service meshes. We started integrating
[istio](https://istio.io/) into this module. [istio](https://istio.io/) addresses the challenges developers and
operators face as monolithic applications transition towards a distributed microservice architecture.

## Service Mesh Packages

Following packages are included in Fury Kubernetes Service Mesh katalog.

-   [istio](katalog/istio): Istio provides behavioral insights and operational control over the service mesh as a whole,
    offering a complete solution to satisfy the diverse requirements of microservice applications. It needs a two phase
    installation. First run: [istio/init](katalog/istio/init) package. Once completed, you are ready to deploy
    [istio](katalog/istio) package. Version: **1.9.5**.

## Requirements

All packages in this repository have following dependencies, for package specific dependencies please visit the
single package's documentation:

-   [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) >= `v1.17.0`
-   [Furyctl](https://github.com/sighup-io/furyctl) package manager to install Fury packages
-   [Kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize) = `v3.9.1`

### Deprecation Note

We had to deprecate those versions because of there was a very huge architectural change from istio 1.4 to 1.5.
For every further help regard upgrade from module version `v0.x.0` to `v1.x.x` please contact us.

## Deployment (Istio getting started)

To start using Fury Kubernetes Service Mesh, you need to use
[furyctl](https://github.com/sighup-io/furyctl/blob/master/README.md) and create a `Furyfile.yml` with the list of
all the packages that you want to download.

```yaml
bases:
    - name: service-mesh/istio
      version: v1.0.1
```

and execute

```bash
$ furyctl install
```

to download the packages under `./vendor/katalog/service-mesh`.

See `furyctl`
[documentation](https://github.com/sighup-io/furyctl/blob/master/README.md) for details about `Furyfile.yml` format.

To deploy the packages to your cluster, define a `kustomization.yaml` with the
following content:

```yaml
bases:
    - ./vendor/katalog/service-mesh/istio-operator/profiles/minimal
```

and execute

```shell
$ kustomize build . | kubectl apply -f -
```
