# Istio add-on module release v3.0.0

Welcome to the latest release of `istio` module of [`Kubernetes Fury Distribution`](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution) maintained by team SIGHUP.

This is a major release that removes `kuma` and `kong-mesh`  packages from the module, and rename the module itself from service-mesh to istio. `kuma` and `kong-mesh` packages have been moved to their own [`fury-kubernetes-kuma`](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-kuma) add-on module.
