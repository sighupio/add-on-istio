# Service Mesh add-on module release 1.1.0

Welcome to the latest release of `service-mesh` module of [`Kubernetes Fury
Distribution`](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution) maintained by team
SIGHUP.

This is a minor release that updates the [`istio-operator`](../../katalog/istio-operator) package to version `1.12.6` and takes the add-on module to our current standards.

Please note that this release is not compatible with Kubernetes 1.22 or later versions.

## Upgrade procedure

1. Update the version in your `Furyfile.yml` file:

```yaml
bases:
    - name: service-mesh/istio-operator
      version: v1.1.0
```

2. Download the module:

```bash
furyctl vendor -H
```

3. Build your desired profile kustomize base and apply it to the cluster, for example for the `minimal` profile run:

```bash
kustomize build /vendor/katalog/service-mesh/istio-operator/profiles/minimal | kubectl apply -f
```
