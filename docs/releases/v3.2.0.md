‚ö†Ô∏è If you‚Äôre using a version of Istio older than the last two releases, it may not be safe to upgrade directly to this latest version. Significant changes and feature updates introduce compatibility issues and lead the upgrade process to a break. Instead, consider doing incremental updates, moving first to an intermediate version.
