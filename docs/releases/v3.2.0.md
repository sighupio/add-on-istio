Jaeger Operator Upgrade Notes

In this release, Jaeger has been updated to version 1.62.0. If you are using the Jaeger operator as part of your Istio deployment, please note the following updates and distinctions between the Jaeger Operator and the Jaeger Operated components.

In this release, the Jaeger operator resources are now isolated from mesh(Istio) resources and the resources of Jaeger Operator has changed destination from `jaeger` namespace to `observability` namespace. Once you have applied the new manifests and all components are up&running in the `observability` namespace, you have to delete the old pods and resources from the `jaeger` namespace.

1. Before appling the new resources, you must delete the old webhooks:
```bash
kubectl delete mutatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io/jaeger-operator-mutating-webhook-configuration validatingwebhookconfiguration.admissionregistration.k8s.io/jaeger-operator-validating-webhook-configuration -n jaeger
```

2. To build the desired profile for Traced Istio you have to put in your Kustomize base the wanted strategy and apply it to the cluster, in follow examples how use the profiles:

* allInOne
```bash
kustomize build /vendor/katalog/istio/istio-operator/profiles/tracing/simple | kubectl apply -f
```
* production
```bash
kustomize build /vendor/katalog/istio/istio-operator/profiles/tracing/production | kubectl apply -f
```

3. Once you have applied the new resources, you can remove all resources from `jaeger` namespace:


```bash
kubectl delete -n jaeger Jaeger jaeger
kubectl delete -n jaeger servicemonitors jaeger-collector
kubectl delete -n jaeger servicemonitors jaeger-query
kubectl delete -n jaeger service/collector-monitoring           
kubectl delete -n jaeger service/jaeger-operator-metrics        
kubectl delete -n jaeger service/jaeger-operator-webhook-service
kubectl delete -n jaeger service/jaeger-query                   
kubectl delete -n jaeger service/query-monitoring
kubectl delete -n jaeger deployment.apps/jaeger-operator
kubectl delete ns jaeger
```
