# Development notes

## Istio

Here is explained how we develop the Istio package inside the service-mesh SIGHUP module. It's essential to
maintain this document updated. So, any new/modified action has to be written here.

## Runbooks

- [`custom-ca`](custom-ca/): If you need to configure Istio to run with a specific CA
  instead of the self-signed one.


#### Service monitor manifests

This manifests has been templated from the
[katalog/istio-operator/istio/sm.yml](https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/1.9.5/samples/addons/extras/prometheus-operator.yaml)

Once deployed, you will be able to find some `serviceMonitor` Prometheus Operator resources. It is required by Kiali dashboard.
